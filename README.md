# ches.sh

It's chess over ssh! In your terminal, just run

    ssh guest@ches.sh

and use the password "guest" to play a game against another guest!

## Technical stuff

I'm using [perftree](https://github.com/agausmann/perftree) for debugging. This
project would have been absolutely impossible without it.
