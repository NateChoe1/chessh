# ches.sh

It's chess over ssh! In your terminal, just run

    ssh guest@ches.sh

and use the password "guest" to play a game against another guest!

Alternatively, you can use telnet

    telnet ches.sh

Don't worry about the login, that doesn't affect anything for the moment. It may
in a future update, though ;)

## Technical stuff

I'm using [perftree](https://github.com/agausmann/perftree) for debugging. This
project would have been absolutely impossible without it.
